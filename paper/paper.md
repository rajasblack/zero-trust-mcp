# Summary

`zero-trust-mcp` is a lightweight Python library for enforcing zero-trust security policies on tool calls in agent and Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. As large language model (LLM) systems increasingly invoke external tools, structured policy enforcement becomes necessary to prevent unintended privilege escalation, unsafe argument handling, and data misuse.

The library provides a declarative policy engine that evaluates tool calls against explicit allow and deny rules, validates argument constraints, and produces structured security decisions. An enforcement wrapper enables developers to apply these controls transparently around existing tool functions.

# Statement of Need

Modern agent frameworks enable LLMs to autonomously invoke tools such as APIs, databases, and operational services. While protocols such as MCP define structured interfaces for tool interaction, they do not inherently enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Tool inputs generated by probabilistic models may violate implicit assumptions made by downstream systems. Traditional security controls such as network filtering or coarse-grained access control are insufficient for tool-level governance.

`zero-trust-mcp` addresses this gap by providing:

- Default-deny policy enforcement
- Declarative allow and deny rules
- Argument-level validation (type, regex, range, enum)
- Structured decision reporting
- Safe-by-default audit logging with secret redaction

The library allows security controls to evolve independently of agent logic, enabling clearer separation between reasoning and enforcement.

# Installation

```
pip install zero-trust-mcp
Or from source:
git clone https://github.com/rajasblack/zero-trust-mcp.git
cd zero-trust-mcp
pip install -e . 
```

# Usage

### Define a policy:
```
policy_id: example_policy
version: "1.0"
default: deny

allow_rules:
  - tool: get_user
    constraints:
      user_id:
        type: string
        pattern: "^EMP[0-9]{6}$" 
```

# Enforce tool calls:
```from zero_trust_mcp import PolicyEngine, Enforcer, ToolCall

engine = PolicyEngine.from_file("policy.yaml")
enforcer = Enforcer(engine)

def get_user(user_id: str):
    return {"id": user_id, "name": "John Doe"}

call = ToolCall(tool_name="get_user", arguments={"user_id": "EMP123456"})
result = enforcer.enforce(call, get_user)
```
